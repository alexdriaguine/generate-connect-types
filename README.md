# What is this?

This is something that is supposed to generate interfaces for your connected components

Given a input like

```typescript
import {connect} from 'react-redux'
import {State} from './somewhere-appstate'

const t = connect(
  (state: State) => ({
    index: state.index,
    name: state.name,
    ble: state.bla,
  }),
  () => ({
    dispatch: () => console.log('hej'),
  }),
)(Comp)
```

it outputs

```typescript
interface ConnectProps {
  index: number
  name: string
  ble: Bla
  dispatch: () => void
}
```

## Try it out

```shell
# Install deps
yarn # or npm install

# Compile the code
tsc -p tsconfig.json

# Run it
node lib/index.js foo/test.tsx
```

Now `foo/test.tsx` should have an autogenerated interface for the connected props

## Todo

* [x] write the interface to the same file
* [x] integrationtests
* [ ] unit tests
* [ ] make it work for deeply nested literal object types
* [ ] make a vs code extension out of it
