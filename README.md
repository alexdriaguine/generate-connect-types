# generate-connect-types
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generate-connect-types.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/generate-connect-types)

## What is this?

This is something that is supposed to generate interfaces for your connected components

Given a input like

```typescript
import {connect} from 'react-redux'
import {State} from './somewhere-appstate'

const t = connect(
  (state: State) => ({
    index: state.index,
    name: state.name,
    ble: state.bla,
  }),
  () => ({
    dispatch: () => console.log('hej'),
  }),
)(Comp)
```

it outputs

```typescript
interface ConnectProps {
  index: number
  name: string
  ble: Bla
  dispatch: () => void
}
```

## Try it out

```bash
# Be sure to make the path relative from the folder you re in
npx generate-connect-types src/components/foo.tsx

# Or install it globally
npm i -g generate-connect-types
generate-connect-types src/components/foo.tsx
```

Now `src/components/foo.tsx` should have an autogenerated interface for the connected props

## Build

```bash
# Install deps
yarn # or npm i

# Build code
yarn compile # compiles code to javascript

yarn compile:watch # compiles with watch mode
```

## Test

```bash
yarn test

# or watch mode
yarn test:watch
```

## Todo

* [x] write the interface to the same file
* [x] integrationtests
* [ ] unit tests
* [ ] make it work for deeply nested literal object types
* [ ] figure out a way to get more info about an object type instead of just returning it as string
* [ ] make a vs code extension out of it
